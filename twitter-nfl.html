    <h1>Live data streaming using Pyspark; Sentiment Analysis on Tweets about NFL Teams</h1>

    <p>
        In this project, I used PySpark to stream live Twitter data related to all 32 NFL teams and performed real-time
        sentiment analysis to assess how fan sentiment correlates with each team's performance. Tweets were processed
        and scored for positive and negative sentiment, then aggregated and compared against each team's win percentage.
    </p>
    <p>
        The analysis revealed an interesting trend: teams with lower win percentages exhibited more extreme sentiment,
        both positive and negative. This inverse relationshipâ€”illustrated by negative regression lines on sentiment vs.
        win percentage scatterplotsâ€”suggests that struggling teams often generate stronger emotional responses from
        fans.
    </p>
    <p>
        Surprisingly, the distribution of tweets skewed more positive than expected. Histograms showed a left-skew in
        positive sentiment (indicating a higher volume of favorable tweets), while negative sentiment distributions were
        right-skewed, highlighting their relative scarcity. These findings challenge the common assumption that social
        media is overwhelmingly critical of underperforming teams and offer a more nuanced view of fan engagement in
        professional sports.
    </p>
    <p>
        My goal was to investigate how machine learning can enhance human-computer interaction across industries like
        healthcare, security, and customer service.
        I experimented with different model architectures and techniques to improve performance and generalization.
