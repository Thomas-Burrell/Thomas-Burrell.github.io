        This project investigates the claim that fighting games are the best genre for competitive esports by analyzing
        real-world data from a Kaggle dataset on esports earnings from 1985 to 2021. The original article supporting
        this claim centers its argument around the success of a single player, Daigo Umehara, using his nearly $10
        million in earnings as anecdotal evidence of the genreâ€™s superiority. To test this claim more objectively, the
        project explores key metrics across all esports genres, including the number of players, tournaments, and total
        earnings, with particular attention to the genre classification of each game.

        The analysis reveals a surprising result: despite having the largest number of games, the fighting game genre
        consistently scores low in terms of players, tournament counts, and total earnings. A final visualization
        combining these metrics shows that genres like FPS and MOBA significantly outperform fighting games in nearly
        every measure of competitive success. These findings contradict the original articleâ€™s argument and highlight
        the limitations of drawing broad conclusions from isolated cases. Future iterations of the project could benefit
        from incorporating viewership data to further assess the popularity and reach of each genre in the esports
        landscape.
